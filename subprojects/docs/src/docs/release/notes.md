## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Command line args supported by JavaExec

Since Gradle 4.9, the command line arguments can be passed to `JavaExec` with `--args`. For example, if you want to launch the application with command line arguments `foo --bar`,
you don't need to hardcode it into the build script - you can just run `gradle run --args 'foo --bar'` (see [application plugin](userguide/application_plugin.html) for more information).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### `EclipseProject` tasks defined for `gradle eclipse` may now run in Buildship

The [EclipseClasspath](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.plugins.ide.eclipse.model.EclipseClasspath.html) and [EclipseProject](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.plugins.ide.eclipse.model.EclipseProject.html) tasks both accept `beforeMerged` and `whenMerged` closures, for advanced Eclipse-specific customisation.

Previous versions of Gradle did not execute the closures defined in `EclipseProject` when invoked from Buildship (only those in `EclipseClasspath`). Now Gradle executes them both, similarly to when invoked from the command-line.

This leads to a potential change of behavior in this scenario:
 - These closures were defined for use with `gradle eclipse`
 - The gradle project was later imported into Eclipse, but these definitions were not removed.

The code in these closures will now become active in the `Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project` action.

### Using Groovy GPath with `tasks.withType()`

In previous versions of Gradle, it was sometimes possible to use a [GPath](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/#gpath_expressions) expression with a project's task collection to build a list of a single property for all tasks.

For instance, `tasks.withType(SomeTask).name` would create a list of `String`s containing all of the names of tasks of type `SomeTask`. This was only possible with the method [`TaskCollection.withType(Class)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskCollection.html#withType-java.lang.Class-).

Plugins or build scripts attempting to do this will now get a runtime exception.  The easiest fix is to explicitly use the [spread operator](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/#_spread_operator).
